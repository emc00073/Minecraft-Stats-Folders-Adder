# Minecraft-Stats-Folders-Adder
Sometimes, Minecraft does not save the game correctly, which can lead to the loss of statistics. This program is designed to merge the statistics from the `stats` folder of your last backup with the new one (in case you played for a while after the error and don't want to lose your latest changes).
